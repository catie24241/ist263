        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <h2>Catie Mae Haugen</h2>
        <h3> I grew up in the suburbs of Minnesota with my family and her lovely dog. I love to travel, read, and explore different recipes and restaurants. I love to try new things in design and experiences throughout my life. 
            I am a graphic designer living in Syracuse, New York. I am passionate about illustration, motion design, UI/ UX design, and solving design challenges. I knew that design was for me because of the constant chaos and excitement that it brings. No two designers are ever the same and the field is constantly changing. 
            My portfolio displays my dedication to breaking the basic narrative and bringing the true story to life through every aspect of my designs. As I grow as a designer, I continues to bring my dedication to strong voices and narratives into all the different projects.
