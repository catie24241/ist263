    <h1>Social Media Discovery | Top 10 Book Tok Books</h1>
    
    <h3>Google, Snapchat, and tons of other social media platforms are taking over with their “Discovery Stories.” This is my take on this called “Top 10 Book Tok Must Reads.” Book Tok is a trend taking over Tik Tok where users talk and hype up their favorite books and authors. Book tok is a welcoming and fast-paced place full of different types of books, authors, and readers. I combined my passion for reading, motion design, and social media to guide viewers to some of the best books that are loved on Tik Tok. I am slowly working through this list, and I highly suggest you do too! </h3>
