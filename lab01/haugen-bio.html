        <title> Catie Haugen - Bio</title>
    </head>
    <body> My name is Catie Haugen, and I am a junior here at Syracuse University studying graphic design and information 
        management & technology. Within graphic design, I am passionate about motion design and UI/UX design; I took 
        courses in both of these last semesters and learned a lot. I am skilled in a myriad of adobe applications 
        including Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, XD, Lightroom, and Photoshop. I also can work in Figma, 
        which is extremely similar to XD. I am involved in various organizations on campus including magazines, 
        Hill Comm, and greek life. Outside of school, I love to cook, read, and watch reality television shows. At home in 
        Minnesota, I have a sister and a dog. I am looking forward to learning and growing throughout this course!
